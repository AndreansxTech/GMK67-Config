# GMK67-Config

## Keyboard specifications

 This keyboard features a **67% size** format along with **66 buttons** and 1 knob used for **volume control**.  
 The pcb is really easy to swap and it has a 3500mAh battery. On full charge, it typically lasts around **12-15 hours**.
 I also put white keycaps in **japanese style** on it.

## Customization

The one problem that I encountered was with obtaining the software for it.  
Since it is not a very popular keyboard, it required some searching but I found a GitHub Gist with the full digital version of the original paper version.

## Soon, I will start uploading my color schemes in XML format for the GMK67 ZUOYO keyboard
